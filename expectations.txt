I expect this course to be enjoyable, memorable, and fulfilling. Having been exposed to web development over the past six years, I am aware that I still have a long journey ahead. There is a vast realm of web programming knowledge that remains unexplored, and I eagerly anticipate delving into it during this course. Despite working on Content Management Systems in my recent role as a part-time web designer and digital marketing specialist, I believe that my expertise in that field will be significantly enhanced through the assistance of CMSC 100. With intensive learning, I aim to successfully grasp the concepts, terminology, and skills necessary to become an excellent web programmer. :)

> I agree with your expectations, James! I am hoping that this course will help us in our future endeavors in our careers! <3
